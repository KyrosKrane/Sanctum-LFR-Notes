## The Jailer's Vanguard
### The Tarragrue
While clearing trash:

`/i Try to pick up the Ever Beating Heart or The Stone Ward anima powers - it's much easier if everyone has one of those. Do NOT get Ten of Towers; it's trash on LFR.`

The raid lead or assistant should mark players with the Ever Beating Heart power.

For the boss:

`/i When the floor goes black, run to the clear spot. If you get Chains of Eternity, hide behind someone with the Ever Beating Heart or The Stone Heart anima powers.`

`/i If you get a purple circle around you, STAND STILL and let others move away from you - you'll fear them if you run over them. Hero on pull.`


### Eye of the Jailer
`/i Dodge the blue puddles; if you get hit, touch your clones to remove the snare. When he does the giant eye laser, run to the sides and use the extra action button to jump to the other platform.`

`/i When the eye adds come out, tanks will keep them on opposite sides of the room. Split up and kill the adds at the same time. If you get a Desolation Beam (white circle) on you, run away from other players.`


### The Nine
At the start of the fight, put the orange circle marker down somewhere on the edge of the room.

`/i Focus the little add when it comes out. Interrupt Song of Dissolution on Signe. If you get pushed out, run into the boss circle. If you get pulled in, run out of the boss circle.`

`/i Four purple circles around the room -> one person soaks each. Swirly blue circle around you -> MOVE IN and SHARE DAMAGE with others. Giant purple circle around you -> run out - you're a bomb. Dodge the other lines and puddles on the ground.`

`/i If you get a Fragment of Destiny debuff, RUN OUT and join the other two players at the Orange Circle marker. Healers, WAIT to dispel until they're together.`


## The Dark Bastille
### Soulrender Dormazain
`/i When Shackles appear, right click to grab them and run FAR to break the chain. When the floor is covered in red, look for the clear pizza slice and stand there. It can happen once, or a "dance" of five times in a row.`

`/i If you get a Brand (red square) around you, move away from other players. Try to put the square over adds, it makes them take extra damage. Grip/shove the adds together, interrupt and kill them. Hero on pull.`


### Remnant of Ner'zhul
`/i STAY INSIDE THE CENTER CIRCLE AT ALL TIMES or you will get knocked off the platform. When Malevolence is dispelled, everyone will be knocked AWAY from that player. DON'T DISPELL when anyone is near an edge, you will kill them.`

`/i When orbs come out, wait until the tank hits them with Suffering, then kill them. One player picks up dead orbs and takes them to the edge to throw off (extra action button).`

`/i When you get Malevolence, run to an edge and FACE OUT. Don't be in front of the boss. Dodge the crap on the ground. Hero on pull.`


### Painsmith Raznal
It is very helpful if the raid lead or assistant puts a world marker on the center square along each side. It makes it much easier to spot the center ball.

`/i Spikes will come out of the floor in patterns. Watch the pattern, and move to avoid the spikes. Try not to stand on edges of the platform. During transition, just dodge spikes and red swirlies - you can't hit the boss.`

`/i When the Spiked Balls come out, DO NOT TOUCH THEM, they deal huge damage and stun you. Focus the CENTER BALL. Kill it and run through to the other side.`

`/i If you get chains around you, stay away from other players - you will damage them. You go LAST through the spiked balls. Hero on phase 3.`


## Shackles of Fate
### Guardian of the First Ones
`/i Stay away from the giant pillars. When the boss does Purging Protocol, the tanks will move the boss to a pillar. Stand in the white circle until the pillar shatters, then run away from the explosion.`

`/i NEVER STAND ON THE TANKS. Run out if you get a yellow circle around you; you're a bomb, DON'T STACK! Dodge the white lines and the glowy orb floating around. Hero on pull.`


### Fatescribe Roh-Kalo
`/i Dodge the black beams. Careful, they go all the way across the room, but you can only see half of them. FOCUS ADDS ALWAYS. Dodge the circles and orbs. Save hero for phase 3.`

`/i When the rings activate, ONE PLAYER stands on each rune (more than one does nothing). Stay with the rune as it rotates into its hexagon slot. DO ALL THE RINGS OR WE WIPE. Everyone else, kill the adds.`

If tanks need info on the fight:

`/i When you get a big ring around you, run JUST outside the group. An add will chase you, just kite it into the dps. Don't let it touch you. When the other tank gets the ring, taunt boss. Pick up the big adds during transition.`

Alternate strategy, with good healers:

`/i When you get a big ring around you, run JUST outside the group. Touch the add that appears. HEALERS - save cooldowns for this. When the other tank gets the ring, taunt boss. Pick up the big adds during transition.`


### Kel'Thuzad
`/i KILL THE TANK CLONES IMMEDIATELY. Interrupt the clones cast. ALL DPS stack on the person with the swirly circle to share damage - if rooted; use escapes or wait. DO NOT STACK IT ON TANKS.`

`/i When the giant circle opens under KT, ALL DPS and TWO heals go inside using the extra action button. Kill the Remnant, then use the swirly portal to get out when it explodes (60%/20%).`

`/i Afterwards, kill adds and interrupt their casts. Rinse and repeat 3 times. If you get a big green circle around you, move away from other players. Dodge crap on the ground. Hero AFTER second portal.`


## The Reckoning
### Sylvanas Windrunner
`/i Phase 1: Dodge everything on the ground, dps the little arrows when they appear, don't let them pull you in. Hero on pull.`

`/i Phase 2: INTERRUPT RUIN OR WE WIPE - RANGE, this means you. Chase Sylvanas across the bridges, don't fall off or in the holes. Interrupt and kill trash. Spread for white circles. Dodge the black waves coming from Sylvanas.`

`/i Phase 3: For Wailing Arrow, JUMP TO NEXT PLATFORM until you explode, then come back. When the whole floor goes black, JUMP TO NEXT PLATFORM before she finishes. Dodge crap on the ground. Hero again when the debuff falls off.`

`/i To get to the next platform, just walk off the edge NEAR IT - not a random edge! If you run over black puddles, run to a corner to get dispelled and drop them.`
