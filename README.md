## The Jailer's Vanguard
### The Tarragrue
While clearing trash, encourage people to pick up the Ever Beating Heart or The Stone Heart anima powers - it's much easier if everyone has one of those.

`/i When the floor goes black, run to the clear spot. If you get Chains of Eternity, hide behind someone with the Ever Beating Heart or The Stone Heart anima powers.`

`/i If you get a purple circle around you, RUN AWAY from other players - you'll fear them. Hero on pull.`


### Eye of the Jailer
`/i Dodge the blue puddles; if you get hit, touch your clones to remove the snare. When he does the giant eye laser, run to the sides and use the extra action button to jump to the other platform.`

`/i When the eye adds come out, tanks will keep them on opposite sides of the room. Split up and kill the adds at the same time. If you get a Desolation Beam (white circle) on you, run away from other players.`


### The Nine
At the start of the fight, put the orange circle marker down somewhere on the edge of the room.

`/i Focus the little add when it comes out. Interrupt Song of Dissolution on Signe. If you get pushed out, run into the boss circle. If you get pulled in, run out of the boss circle.`

`/i Four purple circles around the room -> one person soaks each. Swirly blue circle around you -> MOVE IN and SHARE DAMAGE with others. Giant purple circle around you -> run out - you're a bomb. Dodge the other lines and puddles on the ground.`

`/i If you get a Fragment of Destiny debuff, RUN OUT and join the other two players at the Orange Circle marker. Healers, WAIT to dispel until they're together.`


## The Dark Bastille
### Soulrender Dormazain
`/i When Shackles appear, right click to grab them and run away to break the chain. When the floor is covered in red, look for the clear pizza slice and stand there. It can happen once, or a "dance" of five times in a row.`

`/i If you get a Brand (red square) around you, move away from other players. Try to put the square over adds, it makes them take extra damage. Grip/shove the adds together, interrupt and kill them.`


### Remnant of Ner'zhul
`/i STAY INSIDE THE CENTER CIRCLE AT ALL TIMES or you will get knocked off the platform. When Malevolence is dispelled, everyone will be knocked AWAY from that player. DON'T DISPELL when anyone is near an edge, you will kill them.`

`/i When orbs come out, wait until the tank hits them with Suffering, then kill them. One player picks up dead orbs and takes them to the edge to throw off (extra action button).`

`/i Don't be in front of the boss. Hero on pull. Dodge the crap on the ground.`


### Painsmith Raznal
It is very helpful if the raid lead or assistant puts a world marker on the center square along each side. It makes it much easier to spot the center ball.

`/i Spikes will come out of the floor in patterns. Watch the pattern, and move to avoid the spikes. Dodge the red swirlies too. Try not to stand on edges of the platform. During transition, just dodge spikes - you can't hit the boss.`

`/i When the Spiked Balls come out, DO NOT TOUCH THEM, you will instantly die. Focus the CENTER BALL. Kill it and run through to the other side.`

`/i If you get chains around you, stay away from other players - you will knock them around. You go LAST through the spiked balls. Hero on phase 3.`
