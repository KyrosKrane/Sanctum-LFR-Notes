## The Jailer's Vanguard
### The Tarragrue
`/i When the floor goes black, run to the clear spot. If you get Chains of Eternity, hide behind someone with the Ever Beating Heart or The Stone Heart anima powers.`

`/i If you get a purple circle around you, RUN AWAY from other players - you'll fear them. Hero at 35% when he enrages.`


### Eye of the Jailer
`/i Dodge the blue puddles; if you get hit, touch your clones to remove the snare. When he does the giant eye laser, run to the sides and use the extra action button to jump to the other platform.`

`/i When the eye adds come out, split up and kill the adds together. If you get a Desolation Beam on you, run away from other players.`


### The Nine
`/i Focus the little add when it comes out. Interrupt Song of Dissolution on Signe. If you get pushed out, run into the circle. If you get pulled in, run out.`

`/i Four purple circles around the room -> one person soaks each. Swirly blue circle around you -> MOVE IN and SHARE DAMAGE with others. Giant purple circle around you -> run out - you're a bomb. Dodge the other lines and circles on the ground.`

`/i If you get a Fragment of Destiny debuff, RUN OUT and join the other two players at the Orange Circle marker. Healers, WAIT to dispel until they're together.`


## The Dark Bastille
### Remnant of Ner'zhul
`/i If you get Malevolence, RUN TO AN EDGE and face out. Everyone else move towards the player. When dispelled, everyone will be knocked AWAY from that player. Dodge the crap on the ground.`

`/i When orbs come out, wait until the tank hits them with Suffering, then kill them. One player picks up dead orbs and takes them to the edge to throw off (extra action button).`


### Soulrender Dormazain
`/i When Shackles appear, right click to grab them and run away to break the chain. When the floor is covered in red, look for the clear pizza slice and stand there.`

`/i if you get a Brand (red square) around you, move away from other players. Try to put the square over adds, it makes them take extra damage. Grip/shove the adds together, interrupt and kill them.`


### Painsmith Raznal
`/i Spikes will come out of the floor in patterns. Watch the pattern, and move to avoid the spikes. Dodge the red swirlies too. During transition, just dodge spikes - you can't hit the boss.`

`/i When the Spiked Balls come out, DO NOT TOUCH THEM, you will instantly die. Focus the CENTER BALL. Kill it and run through to the other side.`
